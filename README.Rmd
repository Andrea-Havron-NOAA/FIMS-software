# FIMS-software

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of FIMS software platform project is to compare statistical computing environments for use in the [FIMS](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/population-assessments/fisheries-integrated-modeling-system) intiative. This is ongoing research. For more details, see the [Working Document](https://andrea-havron-noaa.github.io/FIMS-software/docs/FIMS-software-exploratory-analysis.html)

## FIMS Software Organization
The FIMS software platform project is organized as follows:

```{r, toc, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(pander)
library(kableExtra)
df <- data.frame(Directory = c("data",'docs','R','results','src','\\\ \\\ src/julia', '\\\ \\\ src/Rcpp', '\\\ \\\ src/stan', '\\\ \\\ src/tmb'),
                 Description = c("data simulation script, simulated data files, and initial values files",
                                 "working documents detailing project and results",
                                 "* model_setup.R: code used to setup TMB and Stan models
                                 \\\n * modular_demo.R: code runs modular example of passing C++ code to different platforms
                                 \\\n * run_models.R: runs different platforms for benchmark study excluding julia
                                 \\\n * utils.R: base functions for R code",

                                 "source files for project",
                                 "* stateSpace.jl: julia file that specifies and run gompertz and logistic models",

pander(df, keep.line.breaks = TRUE, style = 'grid', justify = 'left')
#kbl(df)
```
