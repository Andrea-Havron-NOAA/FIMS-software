### Summary

The goal of this example is to demonstrate how to setup a modular TMB model. This example replicates the standalone [logisticGrowth example](https://github.com/Andrea-Havron-NOAA/FIMS-software/blob/97038654972d02819b1f99211b236f83277e06f8/R/ProfileScripts/logistic_tmb_re.R) in this repository using a modular framework.

### File Structure Overview

The [logisticGrowth modular example](https://github.com/Andrea-Havron-NOAA/FIMS-software/tree/master/ModularTMBExamples/logisticGrowth) uses the following file structure:

1. [Common.hpp](https://github.com/Andrea-Havron-NOAA/FIMS-software/blob/master/ModularTMBExamples/logisticGrowth/Common.hpp)
  - Sets up pre-processing macros
  - Includes all header statements
  - Sets up data and parameter type structures

2. [likelihoods.hpp](https://github.com/Andrea-Havron-NOAA/FIMS-software/blob/master/ModularTMBExamples/logisticGrowth/likelihoods.hpp)
  - Defines lognormal distribution

3. [model.hpp](https://github.com/Andrea-Havron-NOAA/FIMS-software/blob/master/ModularTMBExamples/logisticGrowth/model.hpp): Sets up logisticGrowth C++ templated class 

4. [DerivedQuantities.hpp](https://github.com/Andrea-Havron-NOAA/FIMS-software/blob/master/ModularTMBExamples/logisticGrowth/DerivedQuantities.hpp)
  -Example of including functions that calculate derived quantities

5. [logisticGrowth.cpp](https://github.com/Andrea-Havron-NOAA/FIMS-software/blob/master/ModularTMBExamples/logisticGrowth/logisticGrowth.cpp): TMB interface with model.hpp

6. [logisticGrowth.tpl](https://github.com/Andrea-Havron-NOAA/FIMS-software/tree/master/ModularTMBExamples/logisticGrowth/admb/logisticGrowth.tpl): ADMB interface with model.hpp

5. [modular_demo.R](https://github.com/Andrea-Havron-NOAA/FIMS-software/blob/master/ModularTMBExamples/logisticGrowth/modular_demo.R): I/O R Interface
